Provide a detailed explanation of this approach, including how it works, when it should be applied.
-->

#### API Design

<!--
- Describe applicable REST APIs in detail for this option.
  e.g. API Path and Sample request and response.
- Describe any applicable commands in the CLI.
- Describe Go APIs for any shared components as applicable.
-->

#### Advantages

### Option 2: \<Title\>

#### Description

<!--
Provide a detailed explanation of this approach, including how it works, when it should be applied.
-->

#### Advantages

<!--
- List the key benefits of this approach.
-->

#### Disadvantages

<!--
- List the potential downsides or limitations of this approach.
-->

#### Examples/Use Cases

<!--
- Provide specific examples or scenarios where this approach is effective.

## Recommended Approach

<!--
After describing multiple approaches above, recommend the one that should be adopted. Provide reasoning, e.g.:
- How it is more scalable, secure, or efficient than alternatives.
- How it applies to various design scenarios.
-->

## When to Choose a Different Approach

<!-- 
Outline the circumstances where the recommended approach may not apply. Provide guidelines on how to decide when another approach is more suitable. Explain with examples. 
Conversely, if this guidance is to be strictly followed, clearly state the same. 
-->

## Security Considerations

<!--
Describe any changes to the existing security model of Radius or security 
challenges based on this guidance. For each challenge describe the security threat and its mitigation. 

Examples include:
- Authentication 
- Storing secrets and credentials
- Using cryptography

If this guidance has no new challenges or changes to the security model
then describe how existing security features of Radius are applicable.
-->

## Open Questions

<!--
Document in (Q&A format) unresolved questions or areas that require further exploration or discussion. Use the discussion and feedback to answer these with Radius contributors.
